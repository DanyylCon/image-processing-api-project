#Image Processing API

This is a project for a course that I am taking. It consists of putting together multiple things that I have learned so far.
Those things include working with NodeJS, Express, TypeScript and Jasmine. It also utlizes standard industry practices such
as Unit Testing, linting with ESLint and formatting with Prettier. The project serves and image based on size the user inputs
and saves the image into memory so that next time a cached version is served. This is done by using node's file system module.
